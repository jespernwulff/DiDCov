# DiDCov

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**DiDCov** is an R package designed to assist researchers and analysts working with Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimations. It provides tools for constructing variance-covariance matrices for DiD estimates, accommodating both constant and time-decaying correlations between periods.

The package is currently experimental and under development.
