**DiDCov** is an R package designed to assist researchers and analysts
working with Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimations. It provides
tools for constructing variance-covariance matrices for DiD estimates,
accommodating both constant and time-decaying correlations between
periods.

The package is currently experimental and under development.
